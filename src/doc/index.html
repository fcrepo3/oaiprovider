  <h2><a name="about">1. About This Service</a></h2>
  <p>
    The Fedora OAI Provider Service is part of the 
    Fedora Service Framework and offers a vast improvement over the
    previous, simple OAI provider that Fedora used in previous versions.
    The new provider is based on <a href="http://proai.sourceforge.net/">Proai</a>, 
    an open source caching, polling OAI provider. It has the following
    features: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      Supports any metadata format available through your Fedora
      repository via a datastream or dissemination.
    </li>
    <li> 
      Supports sets that are expressed as RDF relationships in
      your digital objects' RELS-EXT datastreams as exposed via the 
      Resource Index.
    </li>
    <li> 
      Runs as a webapp in any servlet container, acting as a web service
      client to Fedora.
    </li>
    <li> 
      Caches the content of the Fedora disseminations and
      datastreams intended to be exposed as OAI records. This allows for fast
      response times and ensures that the OAI provider can continue to
      run <i>even when Fedora is temporarily stopped</i>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>NEW FEATURES:</b>
    This release of the OAI Provider incorportates the following new features:
    <ul>
      <li> <i>Automatic schema validation.</i><br/>
           Incoming record XML can now be automatically validated and
           rejected if it doesn't conform to the XML schema it declares.</li>
      <li> <i>Support for MPTStore</i><br/>
           As of release 2.2, Fedora now supports an alternate triplestore,
           <a href="http://mptstore.sourceforge.net">MPTStore</a>, for
           the <a href="http://www.fedora.info/download/2.2/userdocs/server/resourceIndex/index.html">Resource Index</a>.  The OAI Provider service has been modified
           to support this configuration option.  It can now be used whether
           the RI is backed by Kowari or MPTStore.
    </ul>
    See the <a href="configuration.html">Configuration Reference</a> for
    more detail on using these new capabilities.

<div class="sec2">
  <h2><a name="installation">2. Installation</a></h2>
  <p>To install the service: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> 
      Make sure you have a suitable database installed (MySQL, PostgreSQL,
      Oracle, or McKoi) and a database user account that can 
      create tables in the database.
    </li>
    <li> 
      Make sure your Fedora repository is running with the
      Resource Index turned ON. This is necessary because the 
      oai provider periodically queries the resource index to 
      discover which records of interest have changed.
    </li>
    <li> 
      Deploy the oaiprovider.war file into your servlet
      container.
    </li>
    <li> 
      Configure the OAI provider as described in the
      Configuration section below.
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-start the webapp (this is often done by restarting 
      the servlet container itself).
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sec2">
  <h2><a name="demo">3. Demonstration / Test Setup</a></h2>
  <p>
    The source distribution of the OAI Provider Service includes several test
    Fedora objects. You can use these objects and the default
    proai.properties configuration file to quickly get an idea
    for how the service works.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Complete installation steps 1-4 above, using most
      of the default values in the <code>proai.properties</code> configuration file, but
      making sure that the following properties are set according to your own
      Fedora installation:
      <ul>
        <li>driver.fedora.baseURL</li>
        <li>driver.fedora.user</li>
        <li>driver.fedora.pass</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure your Fedora installation is configured to retain
      (rather than re-generate) PIDs of objects in the "demo" PID namespace
      on ingest. You can check this in your fedora.fcfg file:
      If one of the values of "retainPIDs" is "demo" or
      "*" (asterisk), Fedora is configured correctly. Otherwise,
      you should add this value and re-start Fedora.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the fedora-admin GUI or fedora-ingest command-line
      utility to ingest all foxml objects in the src/test/foxml
      directory of the Fedora OAI Provider source distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      Start the webapp.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Upon starting, the service will poll Fedora for objects that
    provide oai record content and have changed since its last update.
    It will find the objects you just ingested, request
    appropriate disseminations of each, and save them in its cache.
    Once it has successfully completed a cache update cycle, you
    should be able to hit the front-end (where you installed the service)
    with OAI-PMH verbs. Here are a couple examples:
  </p>
  <div class="code"><pre>http://localhost/oaiprovider/?verb=Identify<br/>http://localhost/oaiprovider/?verb=ListRecords&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc</pre></div>
  <p>
    Now try using fedora-admin to edit one of the datastreams of one
    of the demo objects you just ingested. The next time the
    oaiprovider service polls Fedora for modified records,
    it should pick up this change and make it available via the front-end.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the poll frequency is ten minutes by default -- this can 
    be configured to be more or less frequent by changing the 
    <code>proai.driverPollSeconds</code> in the <code>proai.properties</code> 
    file.
  </p>

<div class="sec2">
  <h2><a name="configuration">4. Configuration</a></h2>
  <p>
    Please consult the <a href="configuration.html">OAI Provider 
    Configuration Reference</a> for a complete list of <code>proai.properties</code>
    configuration options and what they do.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should also take a look at the <code>log4j.xml</code> that
    resides alongside the <code>proai.properties</code> file in
    the webapp's <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> directory.  This file
    controls where log messages will be sent and how much detail they
    will contain.  When first setting up the OAI provider,
    it is recommended that you keep the log level high (DEBUG for
    most categories).
